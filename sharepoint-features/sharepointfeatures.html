					<h2 id="item-1" class="sublist-wrap">Overview</h2>
					<p>
						SharePoint is our #1 Recommended cloud service provider for good reason. With countless easy-to-use tools, SharePoint provides a secure place for file storage and makes collaboration more efficient and customizable. To get the most out of this platform, BAMS highly recommends utilizing features like <strong> Metadata, Custom Views, Searching, Version History and Workflow</strong>
					</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				
				
					
				<div class="content-wrap">
					<h2 id="item-2" class="subsection">1. Metadata</h2>
					<p>
						Metadata is one of SharePoint's most powerful features, and used correctly, can be a great tool for keeping files organized and quickly accessible. In short, metadata is <em>information about information</em>. For example, title and author of a book would be metadat about that book. When you use SharePoint metadata, you are adding information to your files to make them <strong>easier to find</strong>. If you’ve ever said to yourself “What did I name that file, again?”, metadata may be for you.
					</p>
					<h3  id="item-2-1" class="sublist-wrap">
						What is metadata?
					</h3>
					<p>
						The key to metadata is that it describes information about an object, giving <strong>context and detail</strong>. Take a car for example, how would you describe it? You may describe the make, model, year, color, etc. These properties of the car are metadata, giving context and detail.
					</p>
					<div class="media-wrapper">
						<img src="assets/tesla.png" alt=""/>
					</div>
					<p>With SharePoint metadata, some fields are auto populated and others are there for you to add input. In the most basic document library, metadata is typically limited to file type, file name, modified date, and modified by. But there are numerous other fields available to you to choose from. You can see the full list of options below: </p>
					<div class="media-wrapper">
						<img class="drop-shadow" src="assets/column-options.png" alt=""/>
					</div>
					<p>If you would like to add metadata to a list or library, please <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contact BAMS.</span></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-wrap">
					<h2 id="item-3" class="subsection">2. Sorting and Filtering</h2>
					<p>
						Sorting your lists and libraries and implementing metadata go hand in hand. The more your team uses SharePoint,  populated your lists and libraries will be. Eventually there will be pages of information, making it difficult for you to find what you are looking for. If you know what you’re looking for, you can search for it (read more about searching below). However, if you don't know the name of the file, you can use column heading, and your metadata to sort the list. 
					</p>
					<div class="media-wrapper">
						<img class="drop-shadow" src="assets/filter-1.png" alt=""/>
					</div>
					<p>
						In the example above, the list is in alphabetical order by file name, with folders displayed first. You can change this by selecting the column heading and choosing an alternative way for the column to be sorted. In the example below, the list can be filtered several different ways.
					</p>
					<div class="media-wrapper">
						<img class="drop-shadow" src="assets/filter-2.png" alt=""/>
					</div>
					<p>
						Let's say you remember the first name of the file owner starts with a "D". You can filter the list by the first letter of the first name by clicking <strong>column name > Filter By </strong> and selecting the names that start with "D".
					</p>
					<div class="media-wrapper">
						<img class="drop-shadow" src="assets/filter-3.png" alt=""/>
					</div>
				</div>
			
				<div class="content-wrap">
					<h2 id="item-4" class="subsection">3. Views</h2>
					<p>
						SharePoint Views are the basic structure of your site. Lists and Libraries have customizable views to organize and group your data.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are two options when editing views
					</p>
					<div class="list">
						<ul>
							<li><p><strong>Personal</strong> - visible to you only </p></li>
							<li><p><strong>Public</strong> - visible to everyone (if your department needs a specific view and you don’t have permissions to create it, contact BAMS)</p></li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<button class="collapsible">
						<h3 id="item-4-1">Creating Views</h3>
					</button>
					<div class="collapse-content">
						<p>
							To create a new view in a SharePoint Library go to <strong>Library > Settings > Library Settings</strong>. On the bottom of the Library settings page, select <strong>Create View</strong>.
						</p>
						<p>
							After you’ve clicked “Create view”, you can select <strong>Standard View</strong> and then set your view preferences. You can select if you want this to be your default view, if the audience is personal or public, and then select the checkbox options you want to build your view around.
						</p>

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-wrap">
					<h2 id="item-5" class="subsection">4. Searching</h2>
					<p>
						Searching in SharePoint is more than typing a few keywords and pressing ente.  There are many additional features that enhance the quality of your search query and return significantly better search results. 
					</p>
					<h3 id="item-5-1">Where to Search in SharePoint</h3>
					<p>
						To maximize precise results, it is important to know where you are searching. Searching with a list or library will yield more narrow or specific results opposed to searching the entire site. 
					</p>
					<p>
						When you are on your site's homepage, your  search will read the entire site as well as all sub-sites below that site.  If you are in a SharePoint list or library, your search will only return results directly from that list or library.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-wrap">
					<h2 id="item-6" class="subsection">5. Version History</h2>
					<p>
						Likely one of the most useful tools within SharePoint, version history keeps a running list of changes that occurred during the lifetime of your file. You no longer need to save a file with a date or version number in the title. Version history lets you access old versions and shows you the quantity of each version, who created it, and the size of the file. 
					</p>
					<h3  id="item-6-1" class="sublist-wrap">
						Why you should be using version history
					</h3>
					<p>SharePoint's version history creates a new file:</p>
					<div class="list">
						<ul>
							<li><p>- every time you <strong>save your file</strong></p></li>
							<li><p>- every time you <strong>check in a file</strong></p></li>
							<li><p>- when you <strong>overwrite</strong> an existing file</p></li>
							<li><p>- (If co-authoring) every half hour after someone starts <strong>editing a file</strong></p></li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<button class="collapsible">
						<h3 id="item-6-2">Enabling Version History</h3>
					</button>
					<div class="collapse-content">
						<p>
							It's important that you make sure version history is enabled for your library, <strong>don’t assume is is automatically</strong>. If you do not have permission, contact BAMS. To enable or check version history: 
						</p>
						<div class="list">
							<ul>
								<li><p>1. Go to the library or list for which you want to enable</p></li>
								<li><p>2. Select Settings<img class="icon" src="assets/settings.svg" alt="Gear Icon"/>and then select Library Settings or List Settings</p></li>
								<li><p>3. On the settings page, select <strong>Versioning Settings</strong></p></li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<button class="collapsible">
						<h3 id="item-6-3">View an Early Version of a File</h3>
					</button>
					<div class="collapse-content">
						<p>To view or restore an earlier version of a document, follow these steps:</p>
						<div class="list">
							<ul>
								<li><p>1. Go to the list or library with the item or document for which you want to view history.</p></li>
								<li><p>2. Next to the item, select the ... (ellipses).</p></li>
								<li><p>3. Select <strong>Version History</strong></p></li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="content-wrap">
					
					<h2 id="item-7" class="subsection">6. Workflows</h2>
					<p>
						Workflows in SharePoint allow you to send  documents through automated processes that inform your colleagues when it's time to provide input/ask for review or approval, etc. 
					</p>
					<h3  id="item-7-1" class="sublist-wrap">
						What are SharePoint Workflows?
					</h3>
					<p>
						You may already know what a flowchart is. It’s a graphical map of a process, with instructions about what happens at each step. 
					</p>
					<div class="media-wrapper" style="padding: 0">
						<img src="assets/flow-chart-example.png" alt="Network Attached Storage Meme: 'I see you're using your NAS instead of a cloud storage.  I too like to live dangerously.'" />
					</div>
					<p>
						A SharePoint workflow is like a flowchart that operates automatically, enabling hand-off processes to take place. 
					</p>
					<p>
						To illustrate this, we will use the example above. Doing this process <em>manually</em> can often mean time spent waiting for documents to be shared, checked, approved, and tracked. This also can lead to different versions of the same document which leads to confusion and disorganization. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Using the SharePoint document approval workflow, all the checking up, reminders, and sharing is done automatically. Notifications are sent out when someone is late to completing their part, and the workflow is proactively monitoring each step to ensure a successful and streamlined process. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Document approval is one of the many built-in workflows.  Workflows can be customized and set up to serve many business processes of various kinds. BAMS works with several offices and departments to set up unique workflows that ensure successful business continuity, often improving teamwork and collaboration. Contact BAMS if you are interested in discussing options and starting a workflow for your team’s needs
