					<h2 id="item-1" class="sublist-wrap">Overview</h2>
					<p>
						SharePoint is our #1 Recommended cloud service provider for good reason.  With countless easy-to-use tools, SharePoint makes collaboration and file storage more efficient and customizable.  To get the most out of this platform, BAMS strongly urges utilizing features like <strong>Workflow, Customizable Views, Version History, and Metadata.</strong>
					</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				
				
					
				<div class="content-wrap">
					<h2 id="item-2" class="subsection">1. Metadata</h2>
					<p>
						Metadata is one of SharePoint's most powerful features, and used correctly, can be one the greatest tools in keeping files organized and quickly accessbile. It is <em>information information about information</em>A book's title and author or a catalog's number are metadata.  When you use SharePoint metadata, you are adding information to your files to make them easier to find.  Understanding what metadata means is easy. The part to using metadata is planning it out and <em>sticking to it.</em>
					</p>
					<h3  id="item-2-1" class="sublist-wrap">
						What is metadata?
					</h3>
					<p>
						The key part of metadata is that is describes information about an object, giving <strong>context and detail about a topic</strong>.  Take a car for example,  How would you describe it? It has a make, model, year, color, etc. These properties of the car that give it context and value is what we call <strong>metadata</strong>.
					</p>
					<div class="media-wrapper">
						<img src="assets/tesla.png" alt=""/>
					</div>
					<p>With SharePoint metadata, some fields are auto-populated and others are there for you to add input.  In the most basic document library, metadata is typically limited to file type (icon), file name, modified date, and modified by. But there are actually numerous other fields available to you to choose from. You can see the full list of options below.</p>
					<div class="media-wrapper">
						<img class="drop-shadow" src="assets/column-options.png" alt=""/>
					</div>
					<p>If you would like to add metadata to a list or library, please <a href="https://vt4help.service-now.com/sp" style="text-decoration: underline;">contact BAMS</a>.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-wrap">
					<h2 id="item-3" class="subsection">2. Sorting and Filtering</h2>
					<p>
						Sorting your list and libraries, and implementing metadata go hand in hand.  The more your team uses SharePoint libraries and lists, the more they will fill up.  Eventually there will be pages of information, making it difficult for you to find what you are looking for.  If you know what your are looking for, you can search for it (read more about searching below). However, if you dont know the name of the file, You can use column heading, and your metadata to sort the list. 
					</p>
					<div class="media-wrapper">
						<img class="drop-shadow" src="assets/filter-1.png" alt=""/>
					</div>
					<p>
						This list is in alphabetical order by file name, with folders being displayed first.  You can change this by selecting the column heading and choose how you wish for that column to be sorted. In the example below, the list can be filtered alphabetically by first name.
					</p>
					<div class="media-wrapper">
						<img class="drop-shadow" src="assets/filter-2.png" alt=""/>
					</div>
					<p>
						Lets say you remember the first name of the file owner starts with a "D". You can filter the list by the first letter of the first name by going to clicking the <strong>column name > Filter By </strong> and selecting the names that start with "D".
					</p>
					<div class="media-wrapper">
						<img class="drop-shadow" src="assets/filter-3.png" alt=""/>
					</div>
				</div>
			
				<div class="content-wrap">
					<h2 id="item-4" class="subsection">3. Views</h2>
					<p>
						SharePoint Views are the basic structure of your site.  Lists and Libraries have views that organize and group your data.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are two options when editing views
					</p>
					<div class="list">
						<ul>
							<li><p><strong>Personal</strong> - visible to you only </p></li>
							<li><p><strong>Public</strong> - visible to everyone (if your department needs a specific view and you don’t have permissions to create it, contact bams)</p></li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<button class="collapsible">
						<h3 id="item-4-1">Creating Views</h3>
					</button>
					<div class="collapse-content">
						<p>
							To create anew view in a SharePoint Library go to <strong>Library > Settings > Library Settings</strong> On the bottom of the Library settings page, select <strong>Create View</strong>.
						</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-wrap">
					<h2 id="item-5" class="subsection">4. Searching</h2>
					<p>
						Searching in SharePoint is more than typing a few keywords and pressing enter, it has a ton of additional features that allow you to enhance the quality of your search query and get significantly better search results.
					</p>
					<h3 id="item-5-1">Where to Search in SharePoint</h3>
					<p>
						It's important to know where youre searching.  You can get more precise results just by searching in a particular library as opposed to the entire site.  
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Sitewide search boxes</strong> lets search the site you’re in plus all sub-sites below that site, which means that your results might be more wide-ranging than you might have intended.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can also <strong>search a library</strong> which will return results that live directly in the library.  The search bar at the top of SharePoint will search locations based on where you are in the site.  Searching on the homepage will search the entire site, while searching in a document library will search only the contents of <em>that</em> library.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-wrap">
					<h2 id="item-6" class="subsection">5. Version History</h2>
					<p>
						Likely one of the most useful tools within Sharepoint, version history keeps a running list of changes that occured during the lifetime of your file.  For example, you don't need to save a new file with a date or version number in the title.  Version history lets you access old versions and shows you the quanitity of each version, who created it, and the size of the file. 
					</p>
					<h3  id="item-6-1" class="sublist-wrap">
						Why you should be using version history
					</h3>
					<p>Sharepoint's version history creates a new file:</p>
					<div class="list">
						<ul>
							<li><p>- every time you <strong>save youre file</strong></p></li>
							<li><p>- every time you <strong>check in a file</strong></p></li>
							<li><p>- when you <strong>overwrite</strong> an existing file</p></li>
							<li><p>- and if you’re co-authoring, every half hour after someone starts <strong>editing a file.</strong></p></li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<button class="collapsible">
						<h3 id="item-6-2">Enabling Version History</h3>
					</button>
					<div class="collapse-content">
						<p>It is important that you make sure version history is enabled for you library, <strong>dont just assume! </strong>.  If you don’t have permission, contact BAMS. To enable or check version history:</p>
						<div class="list">
							<ul>
								<li><p>1. Go to the library or list for which you want to enable</p></li>
								<li><p>2. Select Settings<img class="icon" src="assets/settings.svg" alt="Gear Icon"/>and then select Library Settings or List Settings</p></li>
								<li><p>3. On the settings page, select <strong>Versioning Settings</strong></p></li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<button class="collapsible">
						<h3 id="item-6-3">View an Early Version of a File</h3>
					</button>
					<div class="collapse-content">
						<p>To view or restore an earlier version of a document, follow these steps:</p>
						<div class="list">
							<ul>
								<li><p>1. Go to the list or library with the item or document for which you want to view history.</p></li>
								<li><p>2. Next to the item for which you want to view history, select the ... (ellipses).</p></li>
								<li><p>3. Select <strong>Version History</strong></p></li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="content-wrap">
					
					<h2 id="item-7" class="subsection">6. Workflows</h2>
					<p>
						Send your documents through automated workflows that inform your colleagues when it's time to provide input or ask your manager to review and approve your stuff.
					</p>
					<h3  id="item-7-1" class="sublist-wrap">
						What are SharePoint Workflows?
					</h3>
					<p>
						You may already know what a flowchart is. It’s a graphical map of a process, with instructions about what happens at each step.
					</p>
					<div class="media-wrapper" style="padding: 0">
						<img src="assets/flow-chart-example.png" alt="Network Attached Storage Meme: 'I see you're using your NAS instead of a cloud storage.  I too like to live dangerously.'" />
					</div>
					<p>
						A SharePoint workflow is like a flowchart that operates automatically requiring a lot less work.
					</p>
					<p>
						To illustrate this, we will use the example above.  Doing this process <em>manually</em> can often mean time spent waiting around for documents to be shared, check, approved, and tracked.  This also can lead to different versions of the same document which leads to confusion and disorganization.
					</p>
					<p>
						Using the SharePoint document approval workflow, all of the checking up, reminders, and sharing is done automatically.  Notifications are sent out when someone is late to completing their part, and the workflow is proactively monitoring each step.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Document approval is one of the many built-in workflows.  Others, like feedback and email notifications workflows have different structures. Contact BAMS if you are interested in starting a workflow for your team.
