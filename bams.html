Knowing best practices for saving and storing your files may be confusing.

							Fundamentally, Microsoft SharePoint is a browser-based <span style="font-weight: 600; color:#C64600;">collaboration and document/data management software solution</span> It is designed for connectivity, and collaboration. SharePoint allows everyone to collaborate and synchronize daily business tasks and responsibilities from a centralized place.

							Version History

						<hr style="width: 50%; text-align: left; margin-left: 0rem; border-top: 1px solid lightgray; border-bottom: : 1px solid white;">
						<div class="article-p">Versions history is one of SharePoint's best features.  It automatically keeps a running track of all changes made to any file in your library.  Version history does a lot, such as:</div>
						<div class="article-p">
							<ul>
								<li>
									1. Removing the need to keep multiple copies of files while it's being developed or reviewed

						<hr style="width: 50%; text-align: left; margin-left: 0rem; border-top: 1px solid lightgray; border-bottom: : 1px solid white;">
						<div class="article-p">SharePoint supports the ability to concurrently edit files in real time by multiple people, Microsoft calls it <span style="font-style: italic">co-authoring</span>.

							Permissions and Access

						<div class="article-p">Document libraries inherit the permissions from the site they live in, so when you create a library, the same people who can access the site can also access the library and its contents.  This is called <span style="font-style: italic">inherited permissions</span>.</div>
						<p class="article-p">Libraries can have their own permissions, though.  You can <span style="font-style: italic">break inheritance</span> meaning only certain people have access to a library in a site.  You or the Site Owner choose who gets access.</p>
						<p class="article-p">Folders, sub-folders, and files can all have their own individual permissions. Special permissions should be used as needed to protect confidential or sensitive data.</p>

							Searching Files

						<hr style="width: 50%; text-align: left; margin-left: 0rem; border-top: 1px solid lightgray; border-bottom: : 1px solid white;">
						<div class="article-p">SharePoint's search functionality makes finding your files incredibly easy.  SharePoint does this by searching through the full text of documents as well as their metadata.  Metadata included the file name, title, author, and any keywords or category systems you've put in place.</div>
						<div class="article-p">

							Metadata

						<div class="article-p">Folders seem natural, but they're an arbitrary way for organizing information.  Think about the folder structure in your most commonly used library. Would you have set it up the same way? Does it make more sense to separate the folders by project? Year? Owner? Office branch?</div>
						<div class="article-p">Welcome to the world of metadata.  Metadata in SharePoint document libraries let you tag files and content with relevant keywords, which then gives you the ability to sort, filter, and group those files whichever way make sense at the time.  This take a little more time to set up, but it beats being stuck with a strategy based on the way one person liked it when they happened to start organizing the files.</div>
						<div class="article-p">Using metadata makes searchability much easier and is especially helpful when new people join your team: they don't have to learn an arbitrary folder scheme to get to the information that is relevant to them.
